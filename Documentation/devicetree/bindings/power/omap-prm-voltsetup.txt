PRM Voltage setup driver for Texas Instruments OMAP SoCs
It is helper driver for voltage controller and allows to customize voltage
setup time, PMIC voltage control hardware interface and clock source timing.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be :
  "ti,omap3-glbl-prm" - for OMAP3 family of devices
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
- "base-address" contains base address of PRM global registers
- sys_clk: name of system clock (SYS_CLK)
- clksetup_time: TCXO stabilization time in micro seconds

Optional Properties:
- autoextclkmode: allows to control the external clock request (CLKREQ) and
  the oscillator. Values are used according with PRM_CLKSRC_CTRL register
  description in OMAP TRM.
- sys_off_mode: bool value selects the mode used to send OFF command. If present
  (true) sys_off_mode pin will be used, otherwise (false) I2C will be used.
- auto_off: bool vlaue enables/disables send OFF command over I2C. Applicable if
  sys_off_mode is false;
- auto_retention: bool vlaue enables/disables send RETENTION command over I2C.
- auto_sleep: bool vlaue enables/disables send SLEEP command over I2C.

Example:
glbl_prm: glbl_prm@48307250 {
	compatible = "ti,omap3-glbl-prm";
	reg = <0x48307250 0x60>;
	reg-names = "base-address";
	sys_off_mode;
	auto_retention;
	autoextclkmode = <2>;
	clksetup_time = <1000>;
	sys_clk = "osc_sys_ck";
};
