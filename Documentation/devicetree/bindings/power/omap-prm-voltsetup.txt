PRM Voltage setup driver for Texas Instruments OMAP SoCs
It is helper driver for voltage controller and allows to customize voltage
setup time, PMIC voltage control hardware interface and clock source timing.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be :
  "ti,omap3-glbl-prm" - for OMAP3 family of devices
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
- "base-address" contains base address of PRM global registers
- sys_clk: name of system clock (SYS_CLK)
- clksetup_time: TCXO stabilization time in micro seconds

Optional Properties:
- autoextclkmode: allows to control the external clock request (CLKREQ) and
  the oscillator. Values are used according with PRM_CLKSRC_CTRL register
  description in OMAP TRM.
- sys_off_mode: bool value selects the mode used to send OFF command. If present
  (true) sys_off_mode pin will be used, otherwise (false) I2C will be used.
- auto_off: bool vlaue enables/disables OFF command over I2C and assertion
  sys_off_mode signal.
- auto_retention: bool vlaue enables/disables RETENTION command over I2C and
  assertion CLQ_REQ signal.
- offmodesetup_time: voltage setup time in micro seconds when the device exits
  the off mode. It used only if sys_off_mode is true. If this value is not
  defined, then time is calculated based on PMIC slew rate and voltage level
  will be used. Claculated time is used also if value in device tree less then
  calculated.

Example:
glbl_prm: glbl_prm@48307250 {
	compatible = "ti,omap3-glbl-prm";
	reg = <0x48307250 0x60>;
	reg-names = "base-address";
	sys_off_mode;
	auto_off;
	auto_retention;
	autoextclkmode = <2>;
	clksetup_time = <1000>;
	sys_clk = "osc_sys_ck";
};
