Core dynamic voltage and frequency scaling driver for Texas Instruments OMAP SoC
It allows to save power during active system state by changing core voltage and
frequency based on CPU performance.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be "ti,omap-core-dvfs"
- l3_clkname: An clock name of core L3 interconnect clock
- dpll_clkname: An clock name of DPLL output clock
- core_dvfs-supply: An reference node of core voltage regulator
- operating-points: An array of 2-tuples items, and each item consists
    of frequency and voltage like <freq-kHz vol-uV>. Physical frequency value
    my be different from value in this array becasue of rounding to closest
    possible value based on integer divider. For example if DPLL output clock
    value is 332Mhz and value in array is 200Mhz then physical frequency will
    be 166Mhz because divider is integer. You have to use frequency values,
    which are multiple of DPLL output frequency to avoid rounding.
- map: An array of 2-tuples items, and each item consists
    of CPU frequency and matching core frequency in kHz.
    CPU frequency values should be used from CPU operating-points array

Optional Properties:
- voltage-tolerance: percent value, which voltage in operating-points array
    may deviate from its value

Example:
	dvfs {
		compatible = "simple-bus";

		core_dvfs: core_dvfs {
			compatible = "ti,omap-core-dvfs";

			l3_clkname = "l3_ick";
			dpll_clkname = "dpll3_m2_ck";
			core_dvfs-supply = <&omap_tps65912_dcdc4>;

			operating-points = <
				/* kHz    uV */
				100000   950000
				200000  1150000
			>;
			map = <
				/* cpu freq, core freq*/
				300000 100000
				600000 200000
				800000 200000
			>;
		};
	};
